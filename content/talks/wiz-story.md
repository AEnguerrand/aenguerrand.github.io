## Description

As Staff Cloud Security Engineer at Ledger, I share how we protect the infrastructure behind one of the world's leading cryptocurrency security companies. This case study explores our journey from fragmented security visibility to comprehensive cloud protection across our multi-cloud environment.

In this talk, I discuss how Ledger leverages Wiz's Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) to secure both our internal infrastructure and protect our customers' sensitive data. We'll cover practical implementations including:

- **Multi-cloud visibility**: How we gained complete oversight across our entire cloud footprint
- **Risk prioritization**: Moving from hundreds of unactionable alerts to contextualized, prioritized threats
- **Shift-left security**: Integrating Wiz Code with GitHub to catch misconfigurations before deployment
- **Data protection**: Using Wiz DSPM to ensure compliance with financial services regulations
- **Runtime security**: Deploying Wiz Sensor across virtual machines for real-time threat detection

Key outcomes include supporting 200+ developers in a centralized security solution, automated compliance through Kubernetes admission control, and demonstrating security excellence that builds customer trust in our cryptocurrency security products.
