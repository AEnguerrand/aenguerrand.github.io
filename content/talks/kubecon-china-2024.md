## Description

Navigating the complexities of supply chain security might seem intimidating, especially with evolving frameworks like SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts).

This talk introduces beginners to the foundational practices required to secure software from build to runtime using CNCF tools. We'll explore how GitHub Actions can automate build processes, integrate with Cosign for keyless artifact signing, and use Kyverno for runtime policy enforcement.
Additionally, we'll discuss how tools like in-toto and Kubescape help manage and verify artifact integrity, providing a holistic view of SLSA compliance in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

To enhance security further, we will also briefly discuss the potential integration of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) into the supply chain. HSMs can offer an added layer of security for key management operations critical to signing processes, ensuring that cryptographic keys are managed securely and are resilient against attack.
