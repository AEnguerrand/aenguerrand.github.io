## Description

Navigating the complexities of supply chain security might seem intimidating, especially with evolving frameworks like SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts). This beginner-friendly session introduces foundational practices required to secure software from build to runtime using CNCF tools.

In this talk, I explore practical implementations of supply chain security within the Kubernetes ecosystem, covering:

- **Automated build security**: Leveraging GitHub Actions for secure build processes and CI/CD pipelines
- **Keyless artifact signing**: Implementing Cosign for seamless artifact signing without managing keys
- **Runtime policy enforcement**: Using Kyverno for enforcing security policies at runtime
- **Artifact integrity**: Utilizing in-toto and Kubescape to verify and maintain artifact integrity
- **Hardware security**: Integrating Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for enhanced key management

Key outcomes include actionable insights for achieving SLSA compliance within the CNCF ecosystem and practical strategies to secure your software supply chain from development to production.
