      Working hands-on with Kubernetes, AWS, Python, Go, and CI/CD in production. I focus on cloud and platform security across multiple teams: securing build and deployment, ensuring software supply chain integrity, and securing Kubernetes platforms. Most of my work sits at the intersection of security, platform engineering, and software engineering.
      
      I lead projects in software supply chain security, cloud security, and threat detection for cloud native platforms. I also work with on-prem environments, Kubernetes, and GitOps platforms used by several teams.
      
      I have spoken at conferences such as KubeCon and AWS Summit, as well as meetups, and have contributed to open source, sharing lessons learned from protecting and operating production platforms.
