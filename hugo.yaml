      Staff Cloud Security Engineer and former SRE with over 6 years of experience securing and scaling AWS and on-premises infrastructure. I specialise in protecting software supply chains and building secure, reliable systems using Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Terraform.
      
      I incorporate security into CI/CD pipelines with SLSA, Sigstore (keyless signing), and policy automation. I have deployed Wiz for cloud posture management and led initiatives that enhanced uptime, shortened deployment times, and strengthened overall security.
      
      Outside of work, I speak at KubeCon and contribute to open-source projects, sharing practical insights into DevSecOps and cloud security.
